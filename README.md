##### Abstract:

Nowadays, industries ensure the quality of their manufactured products through computer vision techniques and non-conventional imaging. 3D scanners and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) systems are commonly used independently for such applications. Furthermore, these approaches combined together constitute a hybrid systems providing a 3D reconstruction and NDT analysis. These systems, however, suffer from drawback such as errors during the data fusion and higher cost for manufacturers. In an attempt to solve those problems, a single active thermography system based on Scanning-From-Heating (SFH) is proposed in this paper. Besides 3D digitization of the object, our contributions are twofold: (i) the non-through defect detection for homogeneous metallic object and (ii) fiber orientation assessment for long fiber composite material. The experiments on steel and aluminum plates show that our method achieves to detect non-through defects. Additionally, the estimation of the fiber orientation is evaluated on carbon-fiber composite material.
